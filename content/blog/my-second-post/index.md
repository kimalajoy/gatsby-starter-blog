I read this interesting article about how a small NPM package called
Leftpad essentially broke a large part of the internet and sparked a debate
about open source software and those who develop in that space.
Leftpad was developed by Azer Koçulu and he had uploaded onto the NPM website.
This small package of just 11 lines ended up being used in many other NPM packages.
"Some of the largest, most widely used npm packages were suddenly broken. One of the
affected packages, React, is used by major websites like Facebook, which created it, and 
wide variety of smaller sites."

Koçulu had almost 300 other NPM packages on NPM and one of which shared a name with 
another company. They used their lawyer to contact Koçulu and request that he change the
name of his package, so they could use it. Koçulu declined so the lawyer reached out to
NPM and they sided with them. This upset Koçulu and so he removed all of his packages
from NPM. This move is what caused some of the most important packages for the web to 
no longer work. The outage was short lived however, because NPM "un-un-published" Koçulu's 
package and the widespread "issue was fixed, about 2 hours after it first emerged."

 Koçulu said that he owed everything to "the people who never gave up with open source philosophy” and he stood by this for his own software. This debacle has brought up issues regarding dependencies and open-source software and who is able to publish or "un-un-publish" someone elses work.
